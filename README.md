```lrc
[00:18.57] "There must be some kind of way out here"
[00:22.71] Said the joker to the thief
[00:27.03] "There's too much confusion
[00:31.62] I can't get no relief
[00:35.73] Businessmen, they drink my wine
[00:40.01] Plowmen dig my earth
[00:44.14] None will level on the line
[00:48.58] Nobody offered his worth"
[00:51.20] Hey
[00:52.70] 
[01:09.28] "No reason to get excited"
[01:13.58] The thief, he kindly spoke
[01:17.75] "There are many here among us
[01:21.64] Who feel that life is but a joke
[01:26.29] But you and I, we've been through that
[01:30.54] And this is not our fate
[01:34.41] So let us stop talk falsely now
[01:38.79] The hour's getting late"
[01:41.95] Hey
[01:43.45] 
[02:49.12] All along the watchtower
[02:53.62] Princes kept the view
[02:57.94] While all the women came and went
[03:02.08] Barefoot servants too
[03:06.34] Outside in the cold distance
[03:10.58] A wild cat did growl
[03:14.84] Two riders were approaching
[03:18.64] And the wind began to howl
[03:22.49] Hey
[03:23.99] 
[03:27.99] All along the watchtower
[03:39.99] 
[03:54.45] All along the watchtower
